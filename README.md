The COVID-19 file shows the relationship between the proliferation of COVID-19 in China vs. the rest of the world. The data suggest that China was impacted a few months 
before the rest of the world, and as COVID-19 began to take hold in other countries, China's COVID-19 numbers leveled off. Using logarithmic regression, the rate of infection
appears to be the same in China and the rest of the world. I also took a look at the countries with the inital highest cases of COVID-19 
and the majority of them are in Western Europe. Italy topped the list with 31506 by mid-march with Iran at 16169, Spain at 11748 and Germany
at 9257 to name a few. 

The Food Price Forecase file takes a look at the food prices in Rwanda as agriculture makes up over 30% of it's economy and 60% of 
its exports. Specifically, I took a look at potato and pea prices with potatos increasing from 2013 and peas holding steady. I created
a time series which indicated a strong seasonality and increase in prices after 2016. The same was conducted on pea prices with prices fluctuating
seaonally, but increasing very little in the future.
